<p style="color:red";><li><b> Mt. Khangchendzonga</li></b></p>
<p style="color:red";>Kangchenjunga, also spelled Kanchenjunga, KanchanjanghƒÅ and Khangchendzonga, is the third-highest mountain in 
the world. Its summit lies at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) in a section of the Himalayas, the Kangchenjunga Himal, 
which is bounded in the west by the Tamur River, in the north by the Lhonak River and Jongsang La, and in 
the east by the Teesta River. It lies in the border region between Koshi Province of Nepal and Sikkim state 
of India, with the two peaks West and Kangbachen in Nepal's Taplejung District and the other three peaks Main,
Central and South directly on the border. 
Until 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by 
the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time,
is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced 
in 1856 that Kangchenjunga is the third-highest mountain of the world. 
The Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown
 and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the
true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of the Kingdom of Sikkim, that the top of 
the mountain would remain inviolate. The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the
adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<li><b>Mt. Kabru</li></b>
<p style="color:green";>The 7338 m summit of Kabru is the site of a mountaineering altitude record, either in 
1883 or in 1905. The English barrister William Graham, the Swiss hotelier Emil Boss and 
the Swiss mountain guide Ulrich Kaufmann reported to have reached a point 30-40 feet below
 this summit, which Graham described as "little more than a pillar of ice", at 2pm on October
 8, 1883. The ascent was questioned by powerful members of the Alpine Club and the Indian Survey 
 Department, though not by their Himalayan climbing colleagues, and has been dismissed for most 
 of the time since. Recent analysis suggests that the mountaineers may have been correct in 
 their assertions after all.[1] If Graham, Boss and Kaufmann did climb to ~7325 m on Kabru it 
 was a remarkable achievement for its time, breaking the existing altitude record by at least
 360 m (assuming a pre-Columbian ascent of Aconcagua) and holding on to it for twenty-six years 
 (when in 1909 an expedition led by Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi reached about 7500 m on Chogolisa.</p>

<li><b>Mt. Pandim</li></b>
<p style="color:Brown";>Mount Pandim is a Himalayan mountain located in Sikkim, India. It has an elevation of 6,691 m (21,952 ft)
above sea level. 
Pandim appears throughout the trekking trail for Goecha La, starting from Dzongri. It is also one of the
prominently seen mountains from Dzongri top and gets closer to the trekking trail as we move towards
Goecha La.</p>

</br>
<br>
<p style="color:darkgreen";>Rabdentse was the second capital of the former Kingdom of Sikkim from 1670 to 1814.
The capital city was destroyed by the invading Gurkha army and only the ruins of the
palace and the chortens are seen here now. However, the ruins of this city are seen 
close to Pelling and in West Sikkim district in the Northeastern Indian state of present-day Sikkim;
Pemayangtse Monastery is one of the oldest monasteries in Sikkim which is close to the ruins.</p>
